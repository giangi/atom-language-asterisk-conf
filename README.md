# atom-language-asterisk-conf

General-purpose syntax support in [Atom](https://atom.io/) for the Asterisk open
source PBX configuration files.

## Disclaimer

This is my first experience in developing a package for Atom, and I have no
previous experience in TextMate grammars. As such, contributions and suggestions
are welcome. The work has been done from scratch and I am well aware it is not
fit to be called comprehensive, bug-free, or even usable, but it works for me to
the point that I can usually benefit from it.
